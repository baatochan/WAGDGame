# We Are Gonna Die Game
A game done in VHDL... We're gonna die...

Authors: [Wojciech Ormaniec][Github TheMesoria], Bartosz Rodziewicz

The game is written as a project task during Digital and Embedded Systems 2 (Uk≈Çady cyfrowe i systemy wbudowane 2) course at the University. It's mainly done for the Spartan-3E FPGA integrated circuit board.

It's very simple game. The main objective in it is to run away with your pink platform from 5 green bombs falling down the screen. The game is endless. The game is over when one of the bombs hits a player. The speed of falling bombs is constant.

More info about the game can be found in the wiki (sadly only in Polish) :/
